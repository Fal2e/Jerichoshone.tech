  <p>
    My name is Jericho Taylon Shone and I recently graduated from Lighthouse Labs with a CyberSecurity Diploma as well as received certificates for JavaScript and HTML5/CSS.
    Prior to my education, I had worked in the construction and heavy machinery operation industry on and off for over 7 years with the family business. Despite a career - change being daunting after a 12 year stint in between education, my aspirations overruled comfort. Over the last year I have developed a vast and diverse set of skills applicable to the information technology industry. My current objective is to find a company whose goals align with my own, express my creativity and get on the computer and build!
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Beyond my work life, I spend a lot of time outdoors. Growing up on Salt Spring Island in British Columbia was a whirlwind of dirt biking, camping and fishing. I also loved playing video games and tinkering on the computer or building computers. I developed a fine balance of these two lifestyles. Now, living in the Kootenays, I still love my video games and do similar outdoor adventures but with snow, I love to ski and sled. Over the last few years, I have settled down with my family - my partner, our dog (Anakin), cat (Jar Jar Binks) and we are looking to keep growing in our newly acquired home.
